Getting a Github Access token
-----------------------------

I tested this on github enterprise, so steps may vary slightly with the github api.
NOTE: <url> listed below should be changed to relevant github api url.

curl -k -u '<github-username>:<github-password>' -d '{"scopes":["repo", "user"],"note":"test?"}' https://<url>/authorizations

This will return a json blob, where one of the keys will be token.

Installation
------------

- Put the script in the /usr/bin
- Create a file called .githubcredentials in your HOME directory and place the following in it


{
	"user": <your github name>,
	"token": <your github token>,
	"github_url": <the github url of the github instance you are using>
}


You will now have the following command available:
git pull\_request

It takes a number of commandline arguments:
- title (--title) (Mandatory) -> The title of the pull request
- Body (--body) (Optional) -> The body of the pull request
- Base (--base) (Optional) -> The base commit to diff against (defaults to master)
- Head (--head) (Optional) -> The head commit to diff against (defaults to current branch, beware that this branch must be pushed remotely first.)
